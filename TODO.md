Things to do:

- [] Finish cleaning up the parsers. These have been imported from the old compiler. Uncomment and reformat.
- [] Improve adding dependencies with find_files() - currently using find_file_with_dependency wrapper in Dependencies module which is gross.
- [] Add Caching
- [] HTMLify (in error messages for template)
- [] Integration tests
- [] Markdown Extra
- [] Implement alias_method_chain - it's just lying around there.
